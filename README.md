# Welcome to TU Hub
TU Hub a social media app for Towson
University students. At Towson, many clubs
have their own way of reaching out to
students whether it’s an Instagram
account, Involved@TU website, etc. It can
be annoying and inconvenient for students
to look in multiple places to know what the
clubs are doing.  ​

TU Hub makes it easier for students to stay
up to date about club activities and events
by providing a single space for all Towson
University events to be viewed. ​
